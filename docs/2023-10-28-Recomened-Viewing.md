# My recommended Youtube Videos/Channels
This is a list of videos that I have complied over the year or so. After I decided that I should make it so that I can send one or two links instead of a dozen. I am going to list out some of the different creator that I decided to curate in this list.

## Johnny Harris
He isn't small anymore but I loved his work at Vox so I naturally followed him after Borders was canceled. But they really only took off after Borders was canceled. His video is on of the first one's on my list and it is probably one of my favorite videos that he has made. It's all about finding the beauty beneath the surface in places where people travel for a cliche. It also has some beautiful drone footage.

I Realized that I mentioned Borders a lot so if you are unfamilar Johnny would travel around the world covering border disputes or interesting history. My favourite video was about Hong Kong was beginning to be intergrated into China.

I feel like nowadays his production value has gone up but it feels less educational. Now it feels like style over substance.

## Dylan Beattie
He gives interesting tech talks.
This one is by far and away his most popular.

## Sarcasmitron
He makes videos on topics that others have not covered in as great of depth. I thoroughly enjoy his videos.

## exurb2a
The only video of his that I have watched is "The Answer is Not A Hut in the Woods" it made me realize that I need to be more patient with my own creative process. This may not count as niche because it has a ton of views but I liked it so much that I think it's worth bending the rules for.
